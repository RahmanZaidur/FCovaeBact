In the burgeoning field of proteomics, this study spotlights the prediction of protein functions in Flavobacterium covae by associating the protein sequences with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. It is a species-specific multi-label classification challenge where each protein sequence can be annotated with multiple GO terms. Using a sophisticated blend of features, homologous neighborhood information and calculated physiochemical properties, a comprehensive picture of the protein landscape is painted. Then four distinct machine learning models were applied, dissecting the relationships between these features and their respective GO terms. Each model's performance is evaluated based on test data accuracy. The trained models were also used to predict the hypothetical proteins' function. Those sequences were unrecognized by the state-of-the-art prediction model - PANNZER. Through this innovative approach to protein function prediction, we uncover a fresh perspective on the molecular biology of Flavobacterium covae, potentially opening new avenues for understanding its pathogenicity.
